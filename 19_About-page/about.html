            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>My Vision related to this channel is to help as much as people i can in learning programing in all the AI chaos. Due to AI many are panicking & have no idea what to do, so I want them to adapt to this chaos by embracing AI into their work and get more productive and learn how to be more efficient and use AI to their advantage in place iof fearing AI.</p>
